Features
Context Understanding: The ChatBot can understand the context of conversations, allowing for more coherent and relevant interactions.
Intent Recognition: It accurately identifies user intents, making it possible to provide appropriate responses based on the user's queries.
Machine Learning: Utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the ChatBot model.
NLP Integration: Employs various NLP techniques to process and interpret user inputs.
Technical Details
Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), NumPy, pandas
Architecture: Sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism
Training Data: Custom dataset designed to train the ChatBot on various intents and responses
